# Companion FX

Companion app for CamAPS FX that reads glucose values from the screen and uploads them to Nightscout.

## Features

- **Screen Reading**: Reads glucose values, trends, and pump data from CamAPS FX
- **Nightscout Integration**: Uploads glucose readings to your Nightscout instance
- **SAGE/IAGE Tracking**: Monitors sensor age and insulin age, uploads to Nightscout
- **Home Screen Widget**: Displays current glucose value and trend graph
- **Multi-Language**: Supports German, English, and French CamAPS FX versions

### Reliability and privacy behavior

- Treatment and device changes are written to a durable Room event ledger before
  any network request. Stable fingerprints, retry state, and explicit Room
  migrations prevent a repeated screen read or a failed request from creating
  duplicate Nightscout treatments or erasing the local queue.
- The CamAPS drawer parser accepts accessibility text first and uses in-memory
  screenshot OCR when the custom-rendered age values are not exposed to the
  accessibility tree. It recognizes the English, German, and French labels for
  sensor insertion, reservoir refill, and sensor expiry.
- The first observation of the currently active sensor or reservoir is marked as
  a baseline. It can populate device-age information, but downstream inventory
  tools can ignore it when counting new supplies.
- OCR screenshots are not written to disk and OCR text is not uploaded. Only
  sanitized timestamps, event type, source, confidence, and stable event IDs
  are sent with treatment records.
- The background reader wakes the display only for a short read and does not
  force-lock the phone afterwards. If Android denies exact-alarm access, the
  service falls back to an inexact idle-aware alarm instead of crashing.

- Default: 1 minute
- Options: 1 min, 5 min, 15 min

### SAGE/IAGE Interval

Configure how often sensor and insulin age are checked:
- Default: 30 minutes
- Options: 1 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 6 hours

## Supported Devices

### Nightscout upload fails

1. Check your Nightscout URL (no trailing slash)
2. Verify API Secret is correct
3. Test connection in Settings
